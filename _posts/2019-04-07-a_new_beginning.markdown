As one Journey ends, so a new one begins. After working with Flatiron for 3 months as a technical coaching fellow it is time to begin a new leg of the journey I am undertaking. I declared my job search on Monday and have been trying to figure out where I fit best in the current market. I have found it to be challenging to keep up with the requirements needed to maintain the guarantee from Flatiron but I realize why they have such stringent requirements as their methods are almost sure to help me land a position should I take advantage of their system. I have applied to a few companies, mostly looking for positions programming with a coding bootcamp or teaching at one. I've started in this direction because I think it's where I fit best in my current position and I would enjoy taking on a role in that area. We shall see who, if anybody, responds to my outreach and what comes of it soon. 

Until next time, 

Austin
