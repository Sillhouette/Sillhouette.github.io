The Job search continues, Made some potential progress with Credit Karma as one of the people I reached out to reffered me to someone else better suited to handle my application. I also had a meeting regarding the position with the online team at Flatiron and that is a bit bittersweet. They still seem interested in having me come on full time but dont seem to have a position for me to fill. It gets hard with the cohort lead position as current leads are finishing up and will be taking the new cohorts just joining. Regarding that position the hope is that so many students join cohorts that they need to hire a new lead. On another front I reached out to the Regional Director for the west coast regarding potential positions on the new Los Angeles campus that I've been hearing rumors about, we'll see where that goes.

On the programming front I have made it about 70% of the way through the React-native course. We have done alot including authentication, basic component construction, complex component construction. The main focus this week has been on Redux integration, how that works and why it's a good thing. It's awesome to be able to use Redux in a different context then normal React as it's a framework I was already familiar with and this really helped to solidify the concepts for me. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me but until then...

See you next time,
Austin
