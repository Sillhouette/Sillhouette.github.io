Man, it's been a long week hasn't it? It feels like you've just been beaten down at every turn, with something new coming at you every other minute. Everything hurts, either physically, emotionally, or mentally, and there seems to be no end in sight. 

Isn't that feeling just awesome? 

Everyone feels this way, no matter how alone you feel while it's going on, there are plenty of others going through very similar feelings. The issue is, when life gets going like that it's hard to keep pushing forward and making progress. You feel tired, irritable, frustrated, and you don't know what to do. 

The solution, no matter how clich√® it may sound, is to keep pushing on. 

I know. Doesnt sound like much of a solution does it? 

Well, it's really all you can do. You cant afford to let yourself be kept down. You cant afford to let life bring you down and keep you from making progress. In whatever it is, you need to continue moving forward with an attitude that you're going to kick life's in the butt and keep kicking until it getfs up an runs out that door. 

Your attitude affects everything in your life. It affects your work, your relationships, your health and much more. 

The thing is, though, that YOU are in control of your attitude. You control whether you have a positive outlook on life, you make a choice to live in dispair or to live in contentedness. 

Everyone has choices to make, and the choices they make determine what path they walk down in this maze of life. If you choose to have a positive outlook that choice becomes contagious. If you have a good attitude it brings other people up, If you choose to have a bad one, it brings other people down. You cant let things that are out of your control determine how you act towards other people and life in general. You need to make the choice, day after day, to continue forging on with a good attitude so that you can put yourself in the best possible position to continue to be successful. 

Thanks for reading my ramblings,
