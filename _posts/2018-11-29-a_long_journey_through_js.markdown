Javascript was tough for me, I had some trouble connecting the ideas and implementing them properly. Nothing seemed to really click for me until I started to progress on my final project for this section. I finally started to understand the idea of callback functons and how to use them. Javascript can add alot to a webpage, the ability to submit and fetch data asynchronously is phenomenal. I was able to use the asynchronous form submission to make the addition of new user cards in my Magic Manager Pro program to flow alot more smoothly. I was also able to use asynchronous fetching to make the user experience smoother on the user's index page to display his decks, deck details and his cards to him so he can browse them. 

Javascript was difficult for me to get through but after my final project I am confident I have a good grasp on the ideas and how to implement them. It added alot to my rails project and I'm excited to see what else I can do with it to make my projects better. I'm excited to move onto my next step in the program, redux and react.

Until next time, 

Austin
