Today we are going to discuss unit testing and why I think there should be more of an emphasis on it within the Flatiron Curriculum. 

We all know how important unit testing is, it helps us to quickly create working code that fulfills certain expectations. While Flatiron has a great focus on using tests to teach students how to write code, I think it is just as important to teach students how to build their own test suites so they can start to approach projects from a test driven development standpoint from the start of a project to the end. 

As I apply for jobs, there is a consistent desire out there for developers who program from a TDD standpoint and I think it's extremely important for this to be addressed. While there are a couple lessons on tests and testing code they are currently confusing and difficult to follow. They also fail to teach the student how to write any tests, they just teach the student a little bit about how to read them. (I argue that this isn't done very well either) 

Being on AAQ 18+ hours/week nearly every student I talk to has trouble deciphering the output of an error from a test and this makes it really hard for them to figure out how to move forward. Having an emphasis on exactly how tests work and how to craft them would go a long way to helping the students be able to work through the curriculum in a more productive and efficient manner. 

Until next time,
Austin
