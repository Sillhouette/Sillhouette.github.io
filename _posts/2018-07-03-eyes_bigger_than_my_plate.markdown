Alas, we arrived at Sinatra. The road was a bit rough, learning SQL, HTML and CSS all of which I had much to learn from as I've never spent much time with them. I learned alot on that road though, getting better each hour I spent on it and now have a good grasp of the concepts and, of course, Google is my friend in this case. I spent an extended period in the Sinatra section because it's the first time I've done web server/client relationships. I had to really work to understand the relationships and how to structure the routes to do what I wanted them to do. I decided by the end that I wanted to make a shopping list application. As usual I wanted to do far more than what was required of me and it caused the feat to be harder than it should have. I found myself bored, though and not wanting to work on it much because the subject didn't appeal to me all that much. This weekend I was with a friend, and we played an old card game that we frequently revisit. We had a blast that night and it got the cogs turning in my head. My friend had collected tens of thousands of these cards and he was using excel to track them all. What if I made a web application that did the same thing, but more automated, more detailed, and easier to use?

Thus my project idea shifted. I decided that night that I'd be making a card manager for these Magic cards. You could track all the information about them, the names, types, stats, values, condition of the card, everything. You could build decks from them, and choose the formats you want the deck to be used for. It was a huge project, and one that interested me. So I scrapped my first project and got to work. This far I've completed all of the requirements to pass the project through Flatiron but there is so much more to do. I need to move on, now to finish the course in my goal time. But I shall return to finish what I threw onto my plate back then and it's going to be an amazing system. 

Until next time,
