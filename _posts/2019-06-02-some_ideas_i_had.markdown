Today I'm going to talk about some ideas I have for Flatiron to improve their student's experiences;

To start, I really love Flatiron. I beleive in their vision and I love the product they provide I think it really helps people get on a road to success in this industry. There are, however, a few things that I think they could incorperate into their curriculum that would be of great value to the students and provide a better basis for understanding as well as make their students more competitive in the job market once they launch their job search. There are two things that I want to suggest for now: Lessons on Pseudocoding, and Lessons on unit testing. 

Here I will state my thesis for each for these additional sections and I will expand upon those in subsequent blog posts.

1. Pseudocode: This is the process of determining in plain english how you must go about solving a given problem. This is a really great way to plan a solution without getting down and dirty with the code itself and getting lost in a mess of errors. For a new programmer the act of using plain english to plan what to do PRIOR to attempting to implement it is a key component to programming a coherent and logically flowing project. 

2. Unit Testing: While I know there are a few lessons about unit testing within the flatiron curriculum I think they are extremely small and dont cover the subject in a way that is meaningful and helpful for the student. Adding a section towards the end of the program (or language section) would be extremely beneficial for students as they progress. 

Next time we will be taking a closer look at pseudocode and why I argue that it would be extremely beneficial for the students to have a good grasp of. 

Until then, 
Austin
