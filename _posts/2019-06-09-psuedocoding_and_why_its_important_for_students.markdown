Pseudocode: Noun - a notation resembling a simplified programming language, used in program design.

Pseudocoding is basically breaking down a task that you want to accomplish into the logical steps you must take to accomplish that task using plain english, rather than any given programming language. This is a very good way for someone to plan out the logic for some task they want to acheive using the language they are most familiar with, before getting into the weeds 

This is honestly a very simple concept but it goes a long way to helping the students understand what they need before they start absorbing themseelves in their code, hunting for errors. As *developed* programmers (see what I did there?), it becomes habit for us to just talk through what we need to do in our heads right before we write out a method, but for people who have never seen code before, this isn't something that comes naturally and therefore I think it would be a good idea to emphasize it to them for their sake. 

Here is an example of a pseudocoded solution for fizzbuzz:

```
 def fizzbuzz(num)
     if num divided by 3 has a remainder of 0 and num divided by 5 has a remainder of 0
		    print out `fizzbuzz`
		else if num divided by has a remainder of 0
		    print out `fizz`
		else if num divided by has a remainder of 0
		   print out `buzz`
   end
end
```

Having the student do simple exercises like these would help them to develop the skills of pseudocoding in their own heads while programming. Forcing them to explicitly perform these tasks on the page before they start programming would go a long way to helping them plan a good logical route to solving the problems they face.

This is why we should be teaching pseudocode more explicitly.

Next time we will take a look at why we should take teaching unit testing to students more seriously. 

Until then,
