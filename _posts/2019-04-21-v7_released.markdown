Flatiron has released it's latest version of the Web Development curriculum. This comes with many changes including a rebuffed look at git and how it works as well as more coherent HTML and CSS sections. I am excited to dive into these new additions so I can see what else they have to offer me and so I know what I'm looking at when a student comes to me with a problem with the new labs. 

The job search is ongoing, there were some setbacks with the full-time position at Flatiron but I hope we can overcome the issues and move forward with that as I would like to continue working with them. 

That's not to say I'm not open to anything anywhere else. I am continuing my search and applying at other positions I am interested in. 

You can continue to follow my progress via this blog.

Until next time, 
Austin
