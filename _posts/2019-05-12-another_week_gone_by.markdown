Another week has gone by, I got a response from a company! I applied at Clutter for a developer position and they responded to me that they moved me onto the second portion of their selection process. This portion was a coding session done through a third party website. The first two questions were simple enough, I had no difficulty with either of them except that I may have been able to do the second one a bit more effeciently (I failed one test due to timeout) but I skipped that one and moved onto the third question as I had no idea what was in store. 

The third question was a bear of a question. I looked at it for about 20 minutes trying to decipher what they wanted from me and I could not work it out. By the time I was able to kind of figure out what they were asking, my time was nearly up and I had no clue how to even approach solving the issue. I'm very dissappointed with myself over this because it's frustrating to be faced with a problem I cant solve in the time allotted.  

Alas, I have doubts that they will be moving me onto the next portion of their process but I have yet to hear back from them. On another note, I reached back out to Flatiron and got a response from them to set up a meeting to discuss me taking a position with them. We have yet to set a specific time but I'm hoping that goes well as I do enjoy working with Flatiron and would like to continue my work helping their students reach success in their endeavors. 

Until next time,
Austin
