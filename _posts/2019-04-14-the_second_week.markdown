This week was really interesting, it started out normal, working normal hours and whatnot and then out of the blue I'm reached out to by a Recruiter at Flatiron saying they are looking for someone to fill a Cohort Lead position ASAP. Then I went through 3 interviews in quick succession and now I'm waiting for a final decision to come down the pike. I'm really excited for this as it's where I want to be at this point in my life. Fingers crossed they pick me out of the candidates theyre looking at!
