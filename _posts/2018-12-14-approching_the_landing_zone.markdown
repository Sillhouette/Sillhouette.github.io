What a Journey and we are nearly finished. I am now approaching the end, about to start my final project, using react-redux to create an app. I'm excited to be at this point and I'm looking ofrward to completing the course. React was a really nice way to wrap up the Javascript portion of the course. It takes vanilla JS which I had a very hard time with and wraps it into pieces that flow alot better. I like the idea of having components that can be manipulated and displayed based on the information they have access to (their state). I'm exited to see what more I can do with this framework as I know I've only just breached the surface of what it has to offer. I'm still trying to work out what I want to do for my final project. Once I have that figured out its just a matter of time before I can finally make a move towards a career. 

Until next time, 

Austin Melchior
