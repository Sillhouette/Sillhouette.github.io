Another week gone by, looking for a position. I'm trying to find a position as a programming insturctor of some sort. I really enjoy teaching programming and it's something I want to stick with for a while. However it seems there arent so many bites on that side of things so I am starting to widen my search to Developer positions. Looking for backend mostly, developing APIs or using Ruby or Java or something. That would be ideal although I would be willing to work in any position where I can use my newly honed skills. 

Until next time, 
Austin
