This week I started to learn React-Native. I am really excited for this language as it enables me to start developing applications for mobile devices. It is a really cool oppertunity as this allows for development for both IOS and Android platforms. It's not all the difficult so far as I already learned React and React-Native is very similar. I am extremely excited for this as it will allow me to start working on some small side projects I have been wanting to work on. 

See you next time!
